# egendis -- Event generation and display

### Generate events

Events are generated and saved into .pkl files.

TODO: implement a reader for the .pkl files and a histogram maker.

### Event display

For now, this code is not connected with the generator!

TODO: use the generator to create the particles and interpret the particles with the event display code.

### Telegram bot

The idea is executing a telegram bot that reads input processes (tt, ttH, Z...) and generates and returns event displays.
This was created for a master class of particle physics in the CMS detector.
After understanding the different parts of the detector, the students can generate event displays and see the efect of each particle in the detector.
They can also ask for event display and try to guess which are the particles coming from the collision and the initial process.
That could even be implemented in telegram as a test.
